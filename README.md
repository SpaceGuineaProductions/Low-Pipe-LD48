# Low-Pipe-LD48
A game made in 2 days for LD48

In Low Pipe your only objective is to get to the bottom of a randomly generated mine.
Whats stopping you? A bunch of enemies and a giant rock that's falling and crushing the mine! 

How will you get down the mine fast enough? By absorbing the blood of your enemies of course!

You will need Unity Version 2019.4.20f1 or up to open the project.
